# AWS-Serverless-Image-Recognition-Pipeline
A serverless ML inference pipeline built with AWS S3, Lambda, Rekognition, RDS, and CloudWatch. This project compares serverless performance to a VM baseline, evaluating latency, throughput, scalability, and behavior under bursty workloads to highlight the benefits of cloud-native, event-driven ML systems.
